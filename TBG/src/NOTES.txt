	Time speed:
		When the player increases how fast the game runs, the other in-game characters will see the player as 'busy' or 'rushed'.
		The player being percieved as rushed will lead to fewer social calls, fewer chance deals, and less overall interaction. 
		Characters will also have a slighty lower opinion of the player if the player has a low score, and higher conversely. 
		This is becaused being rushed is considered rude unless the person is also successful.
