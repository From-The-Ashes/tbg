Research:
	Record Keeping:
		Allows use of forward/backward navigation on the calendar, as well as allowing visibility of metrics on past actions. 
	Advertising:
		Allows the investment of funds into potential growth, dictated by market status.
Meta:
	Time speed:
		When the player increases how fast the game runs, the other in-game characters will see the player as 'busy' or 'rushed'.
		The player being percieved as rushed will lead to fewer social calls, fewer chance deals, and less overall interaction. 
		Characters will also have a slighty lower opinion of the player if the player has a low score, and higher conversely. 
		This is becaused being rushed is considered rude unless the person is also successful. 
		

To register an event, use clock.getLogger().registerListener(); this is intentionally minimal. 
To create a listener, set a class to implements EventListener, and then use the getEvents() function to return a list of all events to catch.
